## 📖 How to Use the Application
After running the application, follow these simple steps to compute the standard deviation:

1. **Input Your Data**  
   In the input section, enter your one-dimensional array of double-precision floating-point values. For example:  
   `1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5`

2. **Select Calculation**  
   Look for the button labeled "Calculate Standard Deviation." Click it to initiate the computation.

3. **View Results**  
   The calculated standard deviation will appear in the output section. This value represents the dispersion of your input data.

## 🔧 System Requirements
To use this application, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.13+, or a modern Linux distribution.
- **RAM**: At least 2 GB of RAM.
- **Disk Space**: 100 MB of free space for installation files.

## ⚙️ Features
- **One-Pass Algorithm**: Efficiently computes standard deviation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple layout for quick and easy calculations.
- **Supports Float64**: Works with high-precision data.
- **No Programming Knowledge Required**: Designed for average users.

## 📊 Understanding Standard Deviation
Standard deviation measures how spread out the numbers in a set are. A low standard deviation indicates that numbers tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates more spread out numbers. 

This tool can help you understand your data better by providing insights into its variability.
